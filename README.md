Day Planner Assignment

## Description

Here is a short description about my thoughts looking into this project.

<strong>What was your motivation?</strong>
<br>
    -The main motivator when completing this assignment was the constant voice in the back of my mind telling to me to finish as much as possible while feeling under the weather.
<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -This project was my first attempt at utilizing my knowledge of the API's and bootstraps we have been learning in class with jQuery syntax.
<strong>What problems did I encounter?</strong>
<br>
    -There were two problems at the end that I encountered. The first being the localStorage not getting any items but figured out it was a grammatical error. My other problem was figuring out how to switch the colors. I have a rough idea of it but nothing successful. Will tackle it again when healthier. 
<br>
<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<br>
    -I learned a lot about how useful bootstraps are for web development. It takes a lot of stress off of the layout of everything and the styling along with it.
